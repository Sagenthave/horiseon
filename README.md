# Refracture HORISEON website code
## Project Objective 
The purpose of this project was to make the site provided more accessible to the search engines. I will be refactoring the code to include semantic HTML to make the site more accessible. 
**NOTE** Website has been renamed to Horiseon

### Semantic HTML Changes

#### Header 
- The code from line 11-26 has been labelled as the header element
- Within the header the navigation links are listed within under the element 'nav' from line 13-25
**Note** The navigation link for 'Search Engine Optimization' was not working. To fix the link I added an ID. 

#### Main 
- The code from line 28-50 has been labelled as the main content. This section contains the primary information to your webpage and can be found on the in a column on the left hand side. 
- sections that have already been predetermined to seperate content have been identified and labelled as such. 

#### Aside 
- The code from line 51-73 indicates the element that shows beside the main body on the webpage on the right hand side. Because this is secondary information and floats apart from the main body, I have labelled this section as the aside element. 

#### Footer
- The code from line 74-79 has been labelled as the footer (the end of the webpage)
